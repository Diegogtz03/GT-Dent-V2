# GT-DENT
GT-DENT is a Dental Patient Records App which came to be as a help for my parents' dental office. The original version was written to be a Java application, but due to updates, decided to migrate the app to a web version easy to update.

## Features
- Reduce paper waste by transfering records to a digital platform
- Checks for repeated patients
- Dental specific format
- Smart Save to prevent exiting without saving changes
- Search patient by name or date of birth
- Safe Data stored in a RAID NAS
- Print out custom made prescriptions

## Possible Improvements
- Make the app fully customizable for anyone to use
- Allow the deletion of records (Coming soon...)
- Allow other to register for use of the App
